If you haven't read my article on `this` and prototype chain I suggest you to read
them before following along this post.

### Class is just a function internally

Classes in Javascript use `Prototype chain` internally to provide a OOP like syntax.
For example consider a simple class in Typescript and transpile it into ES5 syntax.

```ts 
class Animal {
    
}
```
is similar to 

```js 
"use strict";
var Animal = /** @class */ (function () {
    function Animal() {
    }
    return Animal;
}());
```

Which shows that a class is nothing but a function.

### Typescript provides `public`, `private` and `protected` access modifiers


Typescript provides access modifiers like public, private and protected just like
Java and C++. It also provides a constructor where you could define the functions 
signature and initialize the objects value. 

***

**Public:** 
   
1. If no access modifier is specified Typescript or Javascript will assume that 
   it is a `public` field.
2. We can also mention that a member is public with `public` keyword explicitly.
3. `public` fields can be accessed from outside the class definition.

```ts
class MyClass {
    public myPublicVariable = 0;
}

var obj = new MyClass();
obj.myPublicVariable = 1;
console.log(obj.myPublicVariable); // Outputs : 1
```

As we can see, I updated the value of obj.myPublicVariable to 1 from outside the 
class declaration and it worked fine. Now let's see the transpiled results

```ts
"use strict";
var MyClass = /** @class */ (function () {
    function MyClass() {
        this.myPublicVariable = 0;
    }
    return MyClass;
}());
var obj = new MyClass();
obj.myPublicVariable = 1;
console.log(obj.myPublicVariable);
```

So `public` members are added to each instance of the object created of the `constructor call`.
That means that each object get's different memory space for `myPublicVariable` 
and that is the reason we can mutate it from the outside.

***

**Private:**

1. Any member with `#` prefix in it's identifier name is a private variable. 
2. We can also use `private` keyword to declare private members.
3. Private members are not accessible from outside.

Private members in Typescript
```ts 
class MyClass {
    private myPrivateVariable = 0;
}

var obj = new MyClass();

// Throws error
// Property 'myPrivateVariable' is private and only accessible within class 'MyClass'.
obj.myPrivateVariable; 
```
The above code will throw an error during compilation with Typescript because you
cannot access `myPrivateVariable` from outside the class declaration. Let's looks 
at the transpiled code.

```js
"use strict";
var MyClass = /** @class */ (function () {
    function MyClass() {
        this.myPrivateVariable = 0;
    }
    return MyClass;
}());
var obj = new MyClass();
obj.myPrivateVariable;
```
Hmm... Even though the compiler threw an error the compilation went fine. This is
because typescript always emits output and the type checking is only done at compilation
time. If you get any errors you have to fix them before pushing the code to production.

But there is something else that we must notice here, the `myPrivateVariable` is 
still created on every object exactly like the myPublicVariable. So typescript can
only alert you about type errors at compilation time. If you ignore those errors 
and push them to production you could definitely access myPrivateVariable with no issues.
Here the `private` modifier is just `compilate time` restriction.

**Runtime private members with Javascript**

Javascript has introduced private fields for classes which can be used without
typescript.

```js
class MyClass {
  #myPrivateVariable = 0;
}

var obj = new MyClass();
obj.myPrivateVariable;
```
Here we prefix the `#` sign to the identifier to denote that the member is private.
And it will throw an error during runtime.

> Note: Right now most browsers support this feature. 

***

**Protected:**

Unlike public fields, `protected` fields can only be accessible by the child classes.

```ts
class Animal {
  protected name = 0;
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  private breed: string
  constructor(name: string, breed: string) {
    super(name);
    this.breed = breed;
  } 

  printDog() {
    console.log(`The dog name is ${this.name} and it's breed is ${this.breed}`)
  }
}

var dog = new Dog('Scooby doo', 'Great Dane');

// Outputs: The dog name is Scooby doo and it's breed is Great Dane 
dog.printDog();
```

Here even though the field is defined in parent class `Animal` the child class access
it with the this method. Again this is just for compile time validation with Typescript.
At runtime Javascript doesn't detect this violation.
