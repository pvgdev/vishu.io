  description: `Javascript has some built in functions which are native and their
  behavior is defined by the ECMAScript spec`,
  urlPath: '/notes/javascript/built-in-functions'
}

ECMAScript spec makes it clear that the following functions should be provided by
the JS engine by default. Their behavior is also described in detail by the standards
committee and every JS engine should adhere to those rules.

The following are some of the native functions available in Javascript:

1. Object
2. Function
3. Boolean
4. Symbol
5. Number
6. BigInt
7. Math
8. Date
9. Array
10. Promise 

**And many more...**

### Every object in Javascript is an instance of `Object` function

Every object is an instance of Object and it's 
internal property [[Prototype]] is linked to `Object.prototype`. 

```js 
var obj = {
  a: 10,
  b: 'hello',
  c: function() {
    console.log("This is a function!");
  }
}

console.log(obj instanceof Object); // true
console.log(obj.__proto__ === Object.prototype) // true
```

    <source srcSet={require('./images/Object.png')} type="image/png" />
    <img src={require('./images/Object.png')}  />
  </picture>
</Img>


The above diagram illustrates how things are in computer's memory. Object `obj`
is defined in the global scope and obj has it's internal property [[Prototype]] 
linked to `Object.Prototype`. So `obj` has access to all the properties of 
`Object.Prototype` through prototype chain.

### Every function in Javascript is an instance of `Function` function

Similar to an objects every function is an instance of `Function` function and
every function has it's access to properties on `Function.prototype` through 
prototype chain.

```js
function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

add(a,b); // return 15
```

    <source srcSet={require('./images/Function.png?webp')} type="image/webp" />
    <source srcSet={require('./images/Function.png')} type="image/png" />
    <img src={require('./images/Function.png')}  />
  </picture>
</Img>

### Prototype chain

If a property is not found on an object, JS runtime will check if it has an internal
[[Prototype]] property. If it does exist, JS runtime will check for the property
on the object [[Prototype]] points to.

This process of following through the internal [[Prototype]] property is called 
prototype chain.

Eventually all objects will reach Object.prototype in it's prototype chain and if 
the property doesn't exist on `Object.prototype` the prototype chain will end there
because `Object.Prototype.[[Prototype]]` is `null`.
