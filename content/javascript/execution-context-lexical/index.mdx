}

In this post we will try to understand how javascript `execution context` differs
from regular call stack in languages like C, C++, Java and C#. We will also explore
the concepts of `lexical environments` which allow javascript to treat functions 
as first class citizens and thereby allowing JS developers to use some of the `functional
programming` constructs even though javascript lacks support for immutability.

Before doing that we need to answer few questions regarding how browser executes 
javascript.

### From where does the JS engine in browser start it's execution?

When the browser loads a web page it will look for `<script>` tags and load each
script asynchronously or synchronously depending on the situation. After loading
the scripts JS engine will immediately start parsing the `scripts`.

If there is more than one `<script>` being loaded it will just concatenate all the
script files into a single script.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="a.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="b.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="c.js"></script>
```

Here the script `a.js`, `b.js` and `c.js` will be concatenated into a single script and
the JS engine will treat the concatenated script like a single script file. For the 
purpose of this post I will consider that concatenated script to be `mainScript.js`.

### The call stack, execution context and `mainScript.js` 

Call stack is implemented with a stack like structure which grows and shrinks during
the execution of the program. Each frame in this call stack is called `execution context`.
Initially the call stack starts with concatenated `mainScript.js` and over the time
`execution contexts` are pushed and popped from the call stack.

When the JS engine first start it's execution it will place `mainScript.js` on to 
the call stack and whenever we call a function it places a new execution context on
to the call stack. For example if you had the following program:

```
<script>
function foo() {
  console.log("foo has been called");
  bar();
}

function bar() {
  console.log("bar has been called");
}

foo();
</script>
```

of the call stack is called `execution context`.

### Hoisting, Lexical environments and scope chains 

In languages like C, C++, Java and C# the local variables of a function are stored
on the call stack itself. In javascript the local variables are stored in the heap
in a `tree` like structure.

The JS engine compilation typically takes two passes. 

1. **Hoisting:** JS engine parses the source code and performs tokenizing, lexing and 
   builds the parse trees. During this process it builds a lexical environment which 
   is similar to `symbol table` in other programming languages. A `lexical environment`
   is usually represented using a `scope object` which is just a mapping for local variables 
   and it's values. When these `scope` objects are connected it forms a `scope chain`. 
2. **Execution:** During the execution phase the JS engine starts executing the code line 
   by line. While executing the values of variables in lexical environment are initialized 
   and updated according to program logic. 


For example, consider the following code.

```js
function makeAdder(x) {
  return function(y) {
    return x + y;
  };
}

var add5 = makeAdder(5);
var add10 = makeAdder(10);

console.log(add5(2));  // 7
console.log(add5(3));  // 8
console.log(add10(2)); // 12
```

JS engine will look for all the `var` and `function` declarations and add them to
the active `lexical environment`. Since at the beginning of the program there is no 
active lexical scope JS engine will treat `global` object as scope and
add scope objects whenever a function is invoked.

1. The `global` object is stored somewhere on the heap memory while the execution stack
is stored on the stack memory. 
2. The variable `add5` and `add10` will be undefined since the execution hasn't yet begun. 
3. JS engine creates a function object on the heap memory and points it's internal 
**[[Scope]]** property to `global` object which is the active lexical environment when `makeAdder` is declared.

### Let's analyze how scopes are represented in memory step by step.

1.**`makeAdder(5)` invocation:** 
  - `makeAdder(5)` call is placed onto the call stack.
  - A new scope object is created for `makeAdder(5)` called `makeAdder(5) Scope`.
  - Since `makeAdder` has it's internal [[Scope]] property pointing towards `global object`,
  `makeAdder(5) Scope` will hold a **outer** reference towards `global object`.
  - Since we have one parameter `x` create a variable `x` on that scope object and 
  set it's value to `undefined`.
  - Since `makeAdder` function returns an nameless function and anonymous function 
  is created on the heap memory with empty name("") 
  - This anonymous functions has it's internal [[Scope]] property stores a reference
  towards `makeAdder(5) Scope` because that is the active scope where the anonymous 
  function is declared.
  - Begin the execution of the function and set `x` value to `5`.
  - Return the reference to the anonymous function.

2.**`makeAdder(5)` function call exits:**
  - The returned reference to anonymous function is stored in `add5` variable.
  - Garbage collector cannot remove the scope object `makeAdder(5) Scope` since 
  anonymous function has internal `[[Scope]]` property referencing the `makeAdder(5)
  Scope` object.
  - `makeAdder(5)` is popped from the call stack.

    <img src={require('./images/Execution1.5.png')} />
  </picture>

3.**`add5(2)` invocation:**
  - JS engine will create a scope object `add5(2) Scope`.
  - Since we have one parameter `y` create a variable `y` and set it's value to 
  `undefined`.
  - `add5` is referencing the anonymous function and it has it's internal `[[Scope]]`
  property referencing the `makeAdder(5) Scope` object. `add5(2) Scope` will have 
  an **outer** referencing the `makeAdder(5) Scope`.
  - Execution phase begins. `y` value is updated to given argument value `2`.
  - We need to return `x + y` but there is no `x` variable in `add5(2) Scope` so 
  we will follow the scope chain using the **outer** reference and reach `makeAdder(5) Scope`.
  - There is a `x` variable on `makeAdder(5) Scope` so we calculate `x + y` and return
  the result.
  - We will pop the `add5(2)` function call from the call stack.
  - `add5(2) Scope` object is unreachable and it is waiting for the garbage collector
  to collect it.

4.**`add5(2)` invocation:**
  - JS engine will create a scope object `add5(3) Scope`.
  - Since we have one parameter `y` create a variable `y` and set it's value to 
  `undefined`.
  - `add5` is referencing the anonymous function and it has it's internal `[[Scope]]`
  property referencing the `makeAdder(5) Scope` object. `add5(3) Scope` will have 
  an **outer** referencing the `makeAdder(5) Scope`.
  - Execution phase begins. `y` value is updated to given argument value `3`.
  - We need to return `x + y` but there is no `x` variable in `add5(2) Scope` so 
  we will follow the scope chain using the **outer** reference and reach `makeAdder(5) Scope`.
  - There is a `x` variable on `makeAdder(5) Scope` so we calculate `x + y` and return
  the result.
  - We will pop the `add5(3)` function call from the call stack.

4.**`makeAdder(10)` invocation:** 
  - `makeAdder(10)` call is placed onto the call stack.
  - A new scope object is created for `makeAdder(10)` called `makeAdder(10) Scope`.
  - Since `makeAdder` has it's internal [[Scope]] property pointing towards `global object`,
  `makeAdder(10) Scope` will hold a **outer** reference towards `global object`.
  - Since we have one parameter `x` create a variable `x` on that scope object and 
  set it's value to `undefined`.
  - Since `makeAdder` function returns an nameless function and anonymous function 
  is created on the heap memory with empty name("") 
  - This anonymous functions has it's internal [[Scope]] property stores a reference
  towards `makeAdder(10) Scope` because that is the active scope where the anonymous 
  function is declared.
  - Begin the execution of the function and set `x` value to `10`.
  - Return the reference to the anonymous function.

5.**`makeAdder(10)` function call exits:**
  - The returned reference to anonymous function is stored in `add10` variable.
  - Garbage collector cannot remove the scope object `makeAdder(10) Scope` since 
  anonymous function has internal `[[Scope]]` property referencing the `makeAdder(10)
  Scope` object.
  - `makeAdder(10)` is popped from the call stack.

6.**`add10(2)` invocation:**
  - JS engine will create a scope object `add10(2) Scope`.
  - Since we have one parameter `y` create a variable `y` and set it's value to 
  `undefined`.
  - `add10` is referencing the anonymous function and it has it's internal `[[Scope]]`
  property referencing the `makeAdder(10) Scope` object. `add10(2) Scope` will have 
  an **outer** referencing the `makeAdder(10) Scope`.
  - Execution phase begins. `y` value is updated to given argument value `2`.
  - We need to return `x + y` but there is no `x` variable in `add10(2) Scope` so 
  we will follow the scope chain using the **outer** reference and reach `makeAdder(10) Scope`.
  - There is a `x` variable on `makeAdder(10) Scope` so we calculate `x + y` and return
  the result.
  - We will pop the `add10(2)` function call from the call stack.
  - `add10(2) Scope` object is unreachable and it is waiting for the garbage collector
  to collect it.

Finally the call stack will become empty and the `mainScript.js` will pop out.
Now JS engine will be listening for events and execute them on asynchronously.
