Javascript has the following primitive types.

1. `null`
2. `undefined`
3. `boolean`
4. `number`
5. `string`
6. `object`
7. `symbol`

Primitive types are usually stored in the lexical environment they are defined in. 
Fixed size values like numbers, booleans, undefined or null can be stored as values 
but objects or strings which vary in size are usually stored at some random
location in heap memory. 

```
var a = 10.999;
var b = "hello";
var c = false;
```

### Primitive values don't have internal [[Prototype]] property

Every object in Javascript has an internal `[[Prototype]]` property but primitive
types don't have them because they aren't objects. So primitive values don't have 
have a prototype chain.

[[Prototype]] property.

### Primitive values are not instances of their corresponding Primitive function types.

Primitive types are not instances of their corresponding wrapper functions. 

```js 
var a = 10.999;
var b = "hello";
var c = false;

a instanceof Number // returns false
b instanceof String // returns false
c instanceof Boolean // returns false

console.log(a.toFixed(2)); // return "11.00"
console.log(b.toUpperCase()); // return "HELLO"
console.log(c.valueOf()); // return false
```

So `a`, `b` and `c` are definitely not instances of their corresponding Primitive function
types. Number `10.999` isn't an instance of `Number` or a string literal `"hello"` isn't a instance
of `String`. But we could access property `toFixed` on `10.999` like this `(10.999).toFixed(2)`
like it was an instance of `Number` function. Similarly, we could access `toUpperCase` function
on string 'hello' as if it is the instance of `String` Function.

So what exactly is happening?


The answer is **coercion**. Whenever we try to access a property on a primitive value
javascript converts it into a wrapper object. The wrapper object is basically an 
instance of a Primitive function and will have access to all the properties
on it's prototype.

For example, 

1. `10.999` will be coerced to `Number` instance. So it can access `Number.prototype` 
properties using prototype chain.
1. `hello` will be coerced to `String` instance. So it can access `String.prototype` 
properties using prototype chain.
1. `false` will be coerced to `Boolean` instance. So it can access `Boolean.prototype` 
properties using prototype chain.

### Primitive value coercion is not permanent

```js
var a = 10.999;

a instanceof Number // returns false

console.log(a.toFixed(2)); // return "11.00"

// Still not an instance of Number
a instanceof Number // returns false
```

Primitive value coercion as seen in the previous section is temporary. The coercion
happens every time we access a property on a primitive value.
