In the `protected` section of the previous post we used inheritance with classes 
but never really discussed how it works. So let's decipher that here.

```js 
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
      this.name = name;
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    super(name);
    this.breed = breed;
  } 

  printDog() {
    console.log(`The dog name is ${this.name} and it's breed is ${this.breed}`)
  }
}

var dog = new Dog('Scooby doo', 'Great Dane');

/// Outputs
dog.printDog();
```
When transpiled to ES5 syntax gives

```js
"use strict";

function _inheritsLoose(subClass, superClass) {
  subClass.prototype = Object.create(superClass.prototype);
  subClass.prototype.constructor = subClass;
  subClass.__proto__ = superClass;
}

var Animal = /*#__PURE__*/ (function () {
  function Animal(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  var _proto = Animal.prototype;

  _proto.printName = function printName() {
    console.log("The animal name is: " + this.name);
  };

  return Animal;
})();

var Dog = /*#__PURE__*/ (function (_Animal) {
  _inheritsLoose(Dog, _Animal);

  function Dog(name, breed) {
    var _this;

    _this = _Animal.call(this, name) || this;
    _this.breed = breed;
    return _this;
  }

  var _proto2 = Dog.prototype;

  _proto2.printDog = function printDog() {
    console.log(this.printName() + " and it's breed is " + this.breed);
  };

  return Dog;
})(Animal);

var dog = new Dog("Scooby doo", "Great Dane");
dog.printDog();
```
**Woah that's a lot to take in...**

Let's take this one step at a time

1. `Animal` class is just represented as a function internally. 

```js
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
      this.name = name;
  }

  printName() {
  	console.log("The animal name is: " + this.name)
  }
}
```
is equivalent to
```js
var Animal = /*#__PURE__*/function () {
  function Animal(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  var _proto = Animal.prototype;

  _proto.printName = function printName() {
    console.log("The animal name is: " + this.name);
  };

  return Animal;
}();
```

Every method on a function is typically attached to the Class `prototype`. For example,
`printName` method in class declaration ends up as `Animal.prototype.printName`

***

2. `Dog` is also a class so it should be also be represented as a function. Also 
we should be able to call `super(name)` in the constructor but what does `super`
refer to? `super` is nothing but `Animal` class in this context it must be available
within `Dog` function. We can actually specifically send in `Animal` class as a 
argument to `Dog` function. So the following both are equivalent.

```js
class Dog {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    super(name);
    this.breed = breed;
  } 
}
```

transpiles to 

```js
var Dog = /*#__PURE__*/function (_Animal) {
  _inheritsLoose(Dog, _Animal);

  function Dog(name, breed) {
    var _this;

    _this = _Animal.call(this, name) || this;
    _this.breed = breed;
    return _this;
  }

  return Dog;
}(Animal);
```

***

3. All the methods on class are actually added to .prototype on the Class. For example,
   in the case of `Dog` class the method `printDog()` should be shared among all the
   objects created with `new Dog("Scooby doo", "Great Dane")` call. So we attach the 
   `printDog` method to `Dog.prototype`. Now when new objects are created their internally
   property `[[Prototype]]` points to the memory location `Dog.prototype` points making
   them equivalent. The method invocation of `printDog` will be available to prototype chain.

```js
class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    super(name);
    this.breed = breed;
  } 

  printDog() {
    console.log(`${this.printName()} and it's breed is ${this.breed}`)
  }
}
```

transpiles to 

```js
var Dog = /*#__PURE__*/function (_Animal) {
  _inheritsLoose(Dog, _Animal);

  function Dog(name, breed) {
    var _this;

    _this = _Animal.call(this, name) || this;
    _this.breed = breed;
    return _this;
  }

  var _proto2 = Dog.prototype;

  _proto2.printDog = function printDog() {
    console.log(this.printName() + " and it's breed is " + this.breed);
  };

  return Dog;
}(Animal);
```
***

4. The code in `_inheritsLoose` does something very important let's figure it out.

```js
"use strict";
function _inheritsLoose(subClass, superClass) {
  subClass.prototype = Object.create(superClass.prototype);
  subClass.prototype.constructor = subClass;
  subClass.__proto__ = superClass;
}
```

`subClass.prototype = Object.create(superClass.prototype)` basically makes
`subClass.prototype.[[Prototype]]` point to the same location as `superClass.prototype`.

But why do we do that? 

Every object needs access to `printName` which is available at the `Animal.prototype`
and every object that `Dog` class creates is automatically linked to `Dog.prototype`
via prototype chain. So if we link `Dog.prototype.[[Prototype]]` to `Animal.prototype` every object
will get access to `printName` method.

`subClass.prototype.constructor = subClass;` this purely representational. Changing the
value of `prototype.constructor` has no effect on the code we write. It's there for purely 
representational purposes.

`subClass.__proto__ = superClass;` This part is useful for accessing `static` members of 
parent superClass.
