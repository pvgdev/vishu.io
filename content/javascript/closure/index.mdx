### What is a closure? 

A quick search on MDN will lead to the following definition.

> A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with 
references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, 
a closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. 
In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function 
creation time.

Wait those are too many words and I'm confused. We have already read about **Execution
context** and **lexical environments** in the previous post. Which makes it a lot 
easier to break down these concepts. In fact, we probably already know what is a closure.

```js
function makeAdder(x) {
  return function(y) {
    return x + y;
  };
}

var add5 = makeAdder(5);
var add10 = makeAdder(10);

console.log(add5(2));  // 7
console.log(add5(3));  // 8
console.log(add10(2)); // 12
```

    <img src={require('./images/Closure.png')} />
  </picture>

In the above function `makeAdder(5)` lexical environment should have been garbage
collected in any other language as soon as makeAdder(5) call is returned. But in 
JavaScript the scope object isn't garbage collected. The reason here is that `add5`
holds a reference to anonymous function which in turn holds reference to `makeAdder(5) Scope`
object preventing it from getting garbage collected.

So technically, we can say `anonymous function` has a closure over `makeAdder(5) Scope` 
and the inner function can reach the outer functions scope through scope chain. 

> This is exactly what **closure** is and it allows inner function access the lexical
environment of outer function.
